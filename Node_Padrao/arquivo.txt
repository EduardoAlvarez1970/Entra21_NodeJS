Falcon includes 20 oscillators covering a wide range of modern synthesis methods from basic sample playback to more advanced generators like Pluck, Wavetable and IRCAM Multi Granular.
One of Falcon's greatest strengths is its ability to freely layer oscillators to create elaborate hybrid instruments that capitalize on the unique features of both sample-based and algorithmic sound creation. There are no preset limits on the quantity or type of oscillators you can use, you're limited only by your computers processing power and imagination.\no
